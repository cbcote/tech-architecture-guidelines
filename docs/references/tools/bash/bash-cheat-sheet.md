| `|`        | Pipe: Sends output from one command as input to another     | `ls | grep ".txt"`               | List files, then filter by `.txt` extension using `grep`                |

### Notes:
- **Standard Output (stdout)**: The default output stream for most commands.
- **Standard Error (stderr)**: The output stream for error messages.
- **Standard Input (stdin)**: The input stream for commands (usually from the keyboard or a file).
