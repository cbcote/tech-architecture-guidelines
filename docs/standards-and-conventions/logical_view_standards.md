# System Layers and Components

## Presentation Layer

#### Responsibilities

- Implement user interface accessible through supported platforms.
- Collect data from Core Services and present to end user.
- Allow user to enter valid data into the system.
- Ensure user experience is in line with the organizational standards.

#### Components

- **Web Application**: Built using modern web technologies.
- **Mobile Application**: Developed for both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Desktop Application**: Provides a native-like experience on various operating systems.

#### Examples

- **React.js** for web applications.
- **Flutter** for mobile applications.
- **Electron** for desktop applications.

## Core Services Layer
- Implement core business logic.
- Provide CRUD API and business logic for domain entities modeled as RESTful resources.
- Services are consumed both by presentation layer and external systems.

#### Components

- **Business Logic Services**: Handle the core functionality of the application.
- **API Services**: Expose RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.

#### Examples

- **Spring Boot** for Java-based services.
- **Express.js** for Node.js-based services.

## Infrastructure Layer

- Support other layers by centralizing implementation of cross-cutting concerns:
    - Security
    - Configuration
    - Monitoring
    - Caching
    - Messaging
    - Networking

#### Components

- **Security Services**: Manage authentication and authorization.
- **Configuration Services**: Handle application configuration.
- **Monitoring Services**: Track application performance and health.
- **Caching Services**: Improve performance by storing frequently accessed data.
- **Messaging Services**: Facilitate communication between different parts of the system.
- **Networking Services**: Manage network-related tasks.

#### Examples

- **OAuth 2.0** for security.
- **Consul** for configuration management.
- **Prometheus** for monitoring.
- **Redis** for caching.
- **RabbitMQ** for messaging.

## Integration Layer

- External services consumed by the application

#### Responsibilities

- Manage interactions with external services consumed by the application.

#### Components

- **External API Integrations**: Connect to third-party services.
- **Data Import/Export Services**: Handle data exchange with external systems.

#### Examples

- **RESTful APIs** for external service integration.
- **ETL Processes** for data import/export.
